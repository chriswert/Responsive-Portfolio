                <p class="My-Story">Hi, my name is Christopher Werther but you can call me Chris. I am the son of a
                    retired, 30 year Chief
                    Master
                    Sargent of the U.S. Air Force. Being a military brat, I have lived in many places. I was born in
                    Arizona
                    at
                    Luke Air Force Base, we then moved to Kent Ohio. Our next assignment was to the Air Force Acadamy
                    where my dad
                    worked
                    at the infamous NORAD Space Command installation. We then moved to Naples Italy, Gosnell Arkansas
                    and finaly Ramstein
                    Germany.
                    After graduating from High School in Germany, I took a year to travel europe. In 1995, began college
                    at the University of Arizona. There I met my wife of now 20 years, Christina. After
                    transfering the Northern Arizona University's Online campus and began to finish my Bachelor's Degree
                    while
                    my
                    wife
                    attended Law School at Gonzaga University in Spokane Washington, It is here I decided to explore my
                    pasion in
                    golf.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we moved back to Phoenix, I got a job at a golf course where I quickly learned the day to day
                    operations. I soon began to teach golf and I even passed the PAT test to become a PGA Apprentice.I
                    started
                    to study the
                    buiness adminstration part of the PGA. After 3 years and some life events, I decided that this was
                    not
                    the
                    path I truly wanted to take. After a year away, one of my former Head Golf Pro's called me and asked
                    if I
                    would be interested in working for him at a Golf Management company overseeing the companies courses with their
                    Email
                    Marketing, Website Support and Revenue Management. I took the chance and said yes. The job was great! I learned so much
                    in a
                    short amount of time and I soon realized I really enjoyed the website design and coding of
                    pages.
                    After a year and half with the company, I decided that I wanted to become more proficient in website
                    design
                    and
                    coding. I am now attending school to become a Full Stack Web Developer. My hope is to bring great
                    skill and my
                    passion
                    for golf and begin creating spectacular golf course website designs! </p>
